  "faq": {
    "difference": {
      "question": "What makes this event different from other spiritual workshops?",
      "answer": "This is not a workshop – it's a direct transmission event with authentic lineage-holders from India. Our mentors carry centuries of unbroken spiritual tradition and have been specifically selected for their ability to guide serious Western practitioners. The Swiss setting provides an optimal environment for deep spiritual work while maintaining the highest standards of comfort and accessibility."
    },
    "experience": {
      "question": "Do I need prior experience with meditation or yoga?",
      "answer": "While prior experience is beneficial, it's not required. Our mentors are skilled at meeting students where they are. However, this event is designed for serious seekers ready to commit to genuine spiritual practice. We welcome beginners with sincere intention as well as advanced practitioners seeking deeper guidance."
    },
    "readiness": {
      "question": "How do I know if I'm ready for this level of spiritual work?",
      "answer": "If you're feeling called to something deeper than surface-level wellness practices, if you're seeking authentic transformation rather than temporary relief, and if you're ready to take responsibility for your spiritual growth, then you're likely prepared for this experience. Our mentors will assess your readiness during the initial sessions."
    },
    "sessions": {
      "question": "What should I expect during the private sessions with mentors?",
      "answer": "Each mentor offers a unique approach based on their specialization. Sessions may include personalized meditation instruction, energy healing, spiritual counseling, advanced breathing techniques, or sacred ritual work. All sessions are conducted with utmost respect for your comfort level and spiritual boundaries."
    },
    "professionals": {
      "question": "Is this event suitable for business professionals and executives?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Many of our participants are successful professionals seeking to integrate spiritual wisdom with career excellence. Our mentors understand the demands of modern professional life and offer practical applications of spiritual principles that enhance rather than interfere with your success."
    },
    "accommodation": {
      "question": "What are the accommodation and location details?",
      "answer": "The event takes place in a premium retreat facility (in the countryside of Zürich) in the Swiss Alps, offering comfortable accommodations, organic vegetarian cuisine, (we do not provide accommodation nor food) and stunning natural beauty. Specific location details will be provided upon registration to maintain the intimate and exclusive nature of the gathering."
